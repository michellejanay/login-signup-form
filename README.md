# Login/Sign Up Form

Hi! This project was sparked by a recent UX/UI course, in which I was tasked with mapping a Log in / Sign up User Journey. </br>
In taking the UX course, I knew I wanted to challenge myself further by building some applications 🤓, and this course definitely inspired me ✨ </br>
I learned how to build an ⚛️atomic design system using Figma⚛, a life-saver, learned strategic methods of implementing fonts, colours and themes, and here, I am implementing them with pure CSS 🎨 </br>
I followed a tutorial by Joy of Code for user authentication; keeping my app secure is very important to me! And also to help refresh my memory on working with databases😁
